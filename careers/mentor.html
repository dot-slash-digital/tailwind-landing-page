                        <p>We didn't start Tailwind because we enjoy recruiting, but rather because of how shitty it is. It's the best feeling in the world to get your first job offer straight out of college, but the process of getting to that point is downright miserable. We, personally, were lucky enough to have met the right people in our lives that put us on the right path for starting our careers, but not everyone gets that opportunity. Not only do we want to pass that experience on for our clients, but we want to make it better. The future generation of software engineers deserve better, and we're here to make that a reality.</p>

                        <p>Onwards and upwards,</p>
